# Mobile Flashcards

This project is a simple mobile flashcard app.  
Built using React Native and Redux with [Expo](https://expo.io/), it was developed as a project for the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).  

Users can add and remove decks to which any number of cards containing questions and answers can be added. After adding cards to a deck a quiz can be taken.  

Note: This app has only been tested for Android devices.
